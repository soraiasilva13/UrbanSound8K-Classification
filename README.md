This project was carried out as part of the Machine Learning II course and focuses on the development of deep learning–based classifiers for urban sound recognition using the UrbanSound8K dataset. The goal is to build models capable of correctly assigning previously unseen audio clips to one of ten urban sound categories, such as sirens, dog barking, and drilling. To achieve this, we implemented two approaches: a two-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (2D CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This work was developed during the first semester of the third year of the Bachelor's degree in Bioinformatics.
